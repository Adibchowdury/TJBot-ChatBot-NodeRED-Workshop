## Introduction to Node-RED and TJBot
* Node-RED is an open-source Node.js application that provides a visual programming editor that makes it easy to wire together flows. Node-RED embodies a low-code style of application development, where developers can quickly create meaningful applications without having to write reams of code. There are a number of benefits to low-code application development, all of which we’ve seen first-hand with Node-RED.

 * It reduces the time it takes to create a working application: This allows the real value to be realized much quicker than with traditional development models.
 * It’s accessible to a wide range of developers and non-developers: This is one of the most important benefits we’ve seen. Anyone who understands a domain-specific problem, such as a business analyst, a linguist, or a building engineer, will know the discrete steps needed to solve it. Node-RED gives them the tools to express those steps within a flow and build the solution for themselves.
 * The visual nature helps users to see their application: “Show, don’t tell” is a powerful concept. We often see Node-RED used to demo API capabilities, such as for Watson cognitive services. It’s so effective because the visualization of your application logic shows the art of the possible without having to explain every semi-colon, bracket, and brace. Not everyone thinks in lines of code; the visual representation of application logic is much more relatable.
